# Templates

Shopware Frontends offers two shortcuts to getting started with your custom frontend. These so-called templates offer different levels of "completeness" of a project.

## Demo Store Template

The demo store template is a working online store UI. It comes with all default features implemented as boilerplate code - such as

- Navigation & Header
- Cart
- Checkout
- CMS Pages

It is based on Nuxt3 and Tailwind.css.

## Blank Template

If you like to start from scratch, you can use the blank template. It can be handy if you want to use a different CSS framework or create a completely new frontend.

The blank template has all "non-UI" packages pre-installed, but you have to bring your own styles and components.
